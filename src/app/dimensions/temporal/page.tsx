  definition: "The Temporal dimension in quantum tea brewing refers to the manipulation and understanding of time-based variables beyond simple steeping duration. At the quantum level, time is not a linear constant but a fluid parameter that can be modulated to enhance extraction efficiency and flavor complexity. This dimension accounts for temporal fluctuations, time dilation effects, and the relationship between observer time and tea time.",
  
  scientificBasis: [
    "Quantum temporal mechanics demonstrate that time flows differently at molecular scales, affecting extraction rates non-linearly",
    "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies to temporal measurements, creating extraction probability clouds rather than fixed times",
    "Relativistic effects near the tea-water interface create micro time dilations that influence flavor compound release",
    "Quantum tunneling allows certain molecules to 'skip' through time barriers, appearing in the brew before classical physics would predict"
