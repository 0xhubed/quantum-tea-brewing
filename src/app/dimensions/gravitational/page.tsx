  definition: "The Gravitational dimension in quantum tea brewing explores the influence of gravitational fields, both macro and micro, on the brewing process. This includes the effects of local spacetime curvature, gravitational waves, and the interplay between gravity and quantum mechanics at the scale of tea molecules.
