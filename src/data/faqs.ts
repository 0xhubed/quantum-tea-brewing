    question: 'What is Quantum Tea Brewing?',
    answer: 'Quantum Tea Brewing is a revolutionary approach to tea preparation that applies principles from quantum mechanics to optimize extraction across seven dimensional parameters. By considering temporal, thermal, gravitational, electromagnetic, quantum entanglement, consciousness, and dimensional flux factors, we achieve unprecedented control over flavor development and tea quality.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'Do I need special equipment to start quantum tea brewing?',
    answer: 'While specialized equipment like quantum field modulators and electromagnetic stabilizers can enhance results, you can begin with standard tea brewing equipment. The key is understanding the dimensional principles and applying them within your means. Our calculator helps optimize parameters even without advanced equipment.'

    question: 'Is this method suitable for all types of tea?',
    answer: 'Yes! The 7-Dimensional Steep Method can be applied to any tea type, from delicate white teas to robust pu-erhs. Each tea type responds differently to dimensional adjustments, which is why we provide specific recipes and calculations for optimal results.'

    category: 'Equipment Needed',
    question: 'What is a quantum phase modulator?',
    answer: 'A quantum phase modulator is a device that adjusts the quantum phase relationships between water molecules and tea compounds. While optional, it can significantly enhance extraction efficiency by creating coherent quantum states. You can achieve similar results through careful temperature and timing control.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Equipment Needed',
    question: 'How do I measure consciousness levels?',
    answer: 'Consciousness measurement in quantum tea brewing relates to the observer\'s mental state and focus. While specialized consciousness meters exist, most practitioners develop intuitive awareness through meditation and mindful brewing practices. The key is maintaining consistent attention throughout the brewing process.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Equipment Needed',
    question: 'Can I use a regular thermometer for thermal dimension control?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! While quantum-calibrated thermometers provide more precise readings, a standard digital thermometer works well for thermal dimension control. The important factor is maintaining consistent temperature throughout the brewing process.'
  },
  
  // Scientific Basis
  {
    category: 'Scientific Basis',
    question: 'Is there real science behind quantum tea brewing?',
    answer: 'Quantum Tea Brewing is an experimental project exploring the intersection of quantum concepts and tea preparation. While based on actual quantum mechanical principles, the application to tea brewing is entirely fictional and created for educational and entertainment purposes. It\'s a thought experiment in applying advanced physics to everyday experiences.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Scientific Basis',
    question: 'How does quantum entanglement affect tea flavor?',
    answer: 'In our theoretical framework, quantum entanglement creates correlated states between water molecules and tea compounds, potentially allowing for more efficient and selective extraction of flavor compounds. This leads to more complex and balanced flavor profiles compared to traditional brewing methods.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Scientific Basis',
    question: 'What role does the observer effect play in brewing?',
    answer: 'The consciousness dimension incorporates the quantum mechanical concept that observation affects outcomes. In quantum tea brewing, the brewer\'s attention and intention theoretically influence the extraction process at a quantum level, making mindful brewing an essential component of the method.'

  // Troubleshooting
  {
    category: 'Troubleshooting',
    question: 'My tea tastes bitter even with proper dimensional adjustments. What\'s wrong?',
    answer: 'Bitterness often results from temporal dimension miscalibration or excessive thermal coefficients. Try reducing your temporal coefficient by 0.5-1.0 chronons and lowering temperature by 5Â°C. Also check for electromagnetic interference from nearby devices, which can disrupt optimal extraction patterns.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Troubleshooting',
    question: 'The calculator gives different results at different times of day. Is this normal?',
    answer: 'Yes! The calculator accounts for circadian quantum fluctuations and temporal field variations throughout the day. These natural variations affect dimensional coefficients, particularly the temporal and consciousness dimensions. This is why morning tea often requires different parameters than evening tea.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Troubleshooting',
    question: 'My dimensional flux readings are unstable. How can I stabilize them?',
    answer: 'Dimensional flux instability is often caused by environmental factors like electromagnetic interference, seismic activity, or even strong emotions. Try brewing in a quiet, electrically shielded space, and practice calming meditation before brewing. Grounding techniques can also help stabilize flux readings.'
  },
  
  // Advanced Techniques
  {
    category: 'Advanced Techniques',
    question: 'What is temporal looping in tea brewing?',
    answer: 'Temporal looping is an advanced technique where you create closed timelike curves in your brewing vessel, allowing tea to experience multiple extraction cycles simultaneously. This results in incredibly complex flavor development within standard brewing times. Master the basic dimensions before attempting temporal loops.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Advanced Techniques',
    question: 'How can I achieve quantum coherence across multiple brewing sessions?',
    answer: 'Quantum coherence across sessions requires maintaining consistent environmental conditions and consciousness states. Keep detailed logs of all dimensional parameters, use the same equipment, and practice regular meditation. Some advanced practitioners report success with quantum field anchoring techniques.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Advanced Techniques',
    question: 'Can I combine different teas using quantum superposition?',
    answer: 'Quantum superposition blending is an expert-level technique where multiple teas exist in superposed states until the moment of tasting. This requires precise electromagnetic field control and deep understanding of each tea\'s quantum signature. Start with similar teas before attempting diverse blends.'

  // Safety Considerations
  {
    category: 'Safety Considerations',
    question: 'Are there any safety concerns with quantum tea brewing?',
    answer: 'Quantum tea brewing is a fictional concept and poses no real safety risks beyond those of normal tea preparation. Always use water at safe temperatures, ensure electrical equipment is properly grounded, and maintain good hygiene practices. The dimensional adjustments are theoretical and for entertainment purposes only.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Safety Considerations',
    question: 'Can dimensional manipulation affect nearby electronics?',
    answer: 'In our fictional framework, strong electromagnetic dimensional adjustments could theoretically interfere with sensitive electronics. We recommend keeping phones and computers at least 3 feet away from your brewing area when using electromagnetic field coefficients above 0.5 Tesla.'
  },
  {
    category: 'Safety Considerations',
    question: 'Is it safe to drink quantum-brewed tea while operating machinery?',
    answer: 'Quantum-brewed tea has the same effects as traditionally brewed tea. The dimensional optimization process doesn\'t create any psychoactive compounds. However, the meditative aspect of consciousness-based brewing can be deeply relaxing, so allow time to fully return to normal awareness before operating vehicles or machinery.'
